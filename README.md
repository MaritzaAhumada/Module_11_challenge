# Module_11_challenge
Requirements
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News (40 points)
Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). (10 points)

The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. (20 points)

The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structure—specifically, a list of dictionaries. (10 points)

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data (60 points)
The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types. (15 points)

The data was analyzed to answer the following questions: (10 points)

How many months exist on Mars? (5 points)
How many Martian days' worth of data are there? (5 points)
The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer: (30 points)

Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? (10 points)
Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? (10 points)
How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made. (10 points)
The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file. (5 points)

Grading

Submission
As a reminder, the deliverables for this Challenge are as follows:

Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text.

Deliverable 2: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.

To submit your Challenge assignment, click Submit, and then provide the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.

NOTE
You are allowed to miss up to two Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate. If you complete all Challenge assignments, your lowest two grades will be dropped. If you wish to skip this assignment, click Next, and move on to the next module.

Comments are disabled for graded submissions in Bootcamp Spot. If you have questions about your feedback, please notify your instructional staff or your Student Success Advisor. If you would like to resubmit your work for an additional review, you can use the Resubmit Assignment button to upload new links. You may resubmit up to three times for a total of four submissions.

IMPORTANT
It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.

If you are struggling with a challenge assignment or any aspect of the academic curriculum, please remember that there are student support services available for you:

Ask the class Slack channel/peer support.

AskBCS Learning Assistants exists in your class Slack application.

Office hours facilitated by your instructional staff before and after each class session.

Tutoring GuidelinesLinks to an external site. - schedule a tutor session in the Tutor Sessions section of Bootcampspot - Canvas

If the above resources are not applicable and you have a need, please reach out to a member of your instructional team, your Student Success Advisor, or submit a support ticket in the Student Support section of your BCS application.
